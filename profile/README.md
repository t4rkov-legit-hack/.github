## 🌟 Main Features of Tarkov Cheat

### 🎯 Aimbot

Our Aimbot module delivers precision shooting by automatically locking onto enemy targets. Key highlights include:

* Bone targeting (head, neck, torso)
* FOV customization
* Smoothing options for legit vs rage mode
* Visibility checks
* Silent aim support

### 🔍 ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)

See everything before your enemies do. The ESP overlay displays:

* Player boxes and skeletons
* Health, armor, weapon info
* Loot highlights (rare, legendary items)
* Distance indicators
* Nameplates and team color tags

### 🛋 Wallhack

This module enhances visibility through obstacles by:

* Highlighting enemies behind walls
* Displaying hidden loot
* Rendering terrain and objects transparently
* Offering toggleable vision layers

### 🔫 Triggerbot

Increase your reaction speed with Triggerbot, which automatically fires when your crosshair is over a valid target. Key features:

* Adjustable delay for realism
* Firing control based on weapon type
* FOV-limited targeting

### 🌪 No Recoil

Tarkov’s recoil system is realistic, but that realism can be optimized. Our No Recoil script:

* Eliminates vertical and horizontal kick
* Simulates hand adjustments to avoid detection
* Customizes patterns per weapon loadout

### 🔐 HWID Spoofer

Bypass hardware bans with a built-in **HWID Spoofer** that:

* Spoofs motherboard, GPU, drive, and network identifiers
* Offers randomized profiles or custom config
* Ensures persistent spoofing across restarts
* Includes detection checkers and cleanup scripts

### 🏋 Unlock All Tool

Gain access to every cosmetic item, including:

* Operator skins
* Weapon blueprints
* Attachments and camos
* Calling cards and emblems
* Limited-time and seasonal gear

## 🌟 Why Use Tarkov Cheat?

Using the **Tarkov Cheat** package brings numerous advantages:

### 🚀 Competitive Edge

Gain the upper hand in every gunfight with features like Aimbot and ESP. Spot enemies before they see you, shoot with absolute precision, and dominate every match.

### 🤮 Situational Awareness

ESP and Wallhack allow you to play smart. Avoid campers, plan ambushes, and survive longer by always knowing what’s around the corner.

### 🧩 Enhanced Loadout Access

Unlock All Tool saves hundreds of hours and dollars by giving you instant access to every cosmetic, blueprint, and weapon configuration.

### 🔧 Anti-Ban Measures

HWID Spoofer ensures you can keep playing even after hardware bans. The cheat supports external mode for minimal detection risk.

### 🎓 Learning & Research

Explore reverse engineering, Windows API, overlay rendering, and anti-cheat evasion techniques in a real-world AAA game environment.

## 🔍 Technical Overview

This Tarkov Cheat project uses a combination of advanced techniques to maintain effectiveness and reduce detection risk:

* **External Memory Reading:** No injection required
* **DirectX 11 Overlay:** Undetectable visual rendering
* **Kernel-Mode Drivers (optional):** For low-level spoofing and access
* **Virtual Input Simulation:** Bypasses standard mouse/keyboard hooks
* **Encrypted Configuration Files:** Protect your profiles and preferences

## 🛠 Prerequisites

* Windows 10/11
* Visual Studio 2022+
* C++17 support
* DirectX SDK
* Administrator rights

## 🏋 Performance

The Tarkov Cheat is optimized for:

* Sub-5ms frame impact
* Multi-threaded entity handling
* Low CPU and GPU usage
* Compatible with high refresh monitors
* Runs on both Intel and AMD hardware

## 🔐 Anti-Cheat Awareness

Tarkov uses **Ricochet**, an advanced kernel-level anti-cheat. This project provides insight into detection vectors and prevention strategies:

* Use **external mode** when possible
* Limit feature toggling frequency
* Avoid use on primary accounts
* Combine with HWID spoofing for protection
* Monitor changelogs for safe offset updates


## 🎯 Testing & Safety

* Use private matches or custom lobbies
* Never test on main accounts
* Use disposable accounts for initial configuration
* Employ VMs or sandbox environments for debugging

## 📈 Results and Efficiency

Users have reported the following improvements:

* 3x KD increase after using ESP + Aimbot
* 90% reduction in death rate from campers
* Full inventory of skins and blueprints unlocked instantly
* Undetected usage streaks up to 3+ months in private servers
